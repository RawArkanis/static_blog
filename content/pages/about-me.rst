:slug: about-me

I'm Luiz F. A. de Prá, a Software Developer from Brazil. I currently live in Curitiba, Paraná, and I work with back-end development using C#. I like C# language but my passion is C++. Python and JS have a place in my heart too. I also love to learn more, develop games and side-projects, and play board and video games in my spare time.
