I'm Luiz F. A. de Prá, a Computer Scientist from Brazil. I currently live in Curitiba, Paraná, and I work with back-end development using C#. I like C# language but my passion is C++. Python and JS have a place in my heart too. I also love rock music, to study, to develop games and side-projects, and also play board and video games in my spare time.
